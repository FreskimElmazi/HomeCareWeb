            <h2>About the Service</h2>
            <p class="highlight">
                The Organized Youth Association is a licensed provider of Home Care services, supporting elderly people over 65, individuals with disabilities, and those with reduced functional capacity. This service is designed to help meet the daily needs of these individuals, improving their quality of life and preventing or delaying the need for institutional care.
            </p>
            <p>
                We provide up to 80 hours of assistance per month with daily activities to those who cannot care for themselves independently. This service is offered free of charge, thanks to the Social Services Improvement Project under the Ministry of Social Policy, Demography and Youth, with support from the World Bank.
